This comprehensive report examines a sophisticated deep learning framework developed for forecasting stock price dynamics and sectoral trends in the Indian equity market. The research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze daily adjusted closing prices from 2015-2021 for the BSE Sensex and representative sectoral equities across five key sectors: Energy, IT Services, Banking, Pharmaceuticals, and FMCG.
The study distinguishes itself by prioritizing interpretability, robustness across market regimes, and probabilistic assessment of forecast reliability over mere point prediction accuracy. Key findings reveal that LSTM architectures effectively capture medium-term trend persistence but exhibit performance degradation during abrupt regime shifts, particularly during the COVID-19 market shock. The integration of ensemble learning and Bayesian uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout significantly enhances the practical utility of these models for financial decision-making.
